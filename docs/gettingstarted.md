# Getting Started

## What is Glue?

Glue is a framework built for Roblox game development. 
Glue assists you in writing cleaner netcode and streamlines interaction between fundamental mechanics of your game.
The motivation behind Glue is to leave the way the developer writes their code up to them and let Glue handle the nifty parts.

Glue is inspired by [Knit](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit) and [Nevermore](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine), so some constructs may seem familiar.

* Follow the [installation guide](install.md) to install Glue.
* Follow the [tour](basics.md) for a brief introduction to Glue.
* See [terminology](Guides/terminology.md) for foreign definitions used in the documentation.
